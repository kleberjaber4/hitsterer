QR code scanner web application for playing Spotify songs blindly:
- Log in with a Spotify Premium account.
- Scan a QR code with a Spotify song URL (i.e. [https://open.spotify.com/track/...](https://open.spotify.com/track/4PTG3Z6ehGkBFwjybzWkR8?si=8c83c6d0e3f5404e)).
- The app immediately starts playing the song without revealing any details about it.

For example, physical tiles may be printed with a song's name, artist and/or publication year on the other side. 
To create such tiles, see [https://github.com/Theys96/blind-song-scanner-generator](https://github.com/Theys96/blind-song-scanner-generator).

## Development

This application was built with npm/11.0.0 and vite/5.4.8. 
The project's code is in a work-in-progress state, it has several glitches and many opportunities for refactoring.

To install and start this React app locally, clone the repository and run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

To get the Spotify log-in to work, create a client in the [Spotify for Developers dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com)
